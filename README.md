# useR2019_tutorial

## Keeping an exotic pet in your home! Taming Python to live in RStudio because sometimes the best language is both!

### Pre-tutorial instructions

#### Software and packages

Participants need a laptop with [RStudio 1.2](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) and [Anaconda 3](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) installed. 

Please also install the `reticulate` package and I recommend the development version from github. Installing packages from github requires first installing the `devtools` package from CRAN:

`install.packages("devtools")`

You should be then able to install `reticulate' with:

`devtools::install_github("rstudio/reticulate")`

You can read more about 'devtools' here: https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/devtools.html

We will also use `readxl` and `ggplot2`. Please also install them from CRAN.


#### Tutorial materials
Download this repository. You can do this with the green `Clone or download` button above and selecting Download ZIP.

Extract the files.

#### Information
Please make a note of where your RStudio and Anaconda3 plugins are located. For example, on my windows machine they are:

`C:\Program Files\RStudio\bin\plugins`
`C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Library\plugins`

#### Help!
